# Sunsetting Mirayoki
During the COVID pandemic, Mirayoki served to me an incredible learning experience in the field of serverless app building and the entire management of a digital product. I even branded it behind a bigger startup, being Mirei.

However, as time passed by, it is no longer a route I would like to pursue, for now. Thus, Mirayoki will be finalizing its service by March 1st, 2024.

I will proceed to continue with other passion projects of mine, such as @Institute-Alterna.

This archive serves as the proof of the work I did, with all the downs and ups I experienced as I built it. Who knows? Maybe I pick it up later.
