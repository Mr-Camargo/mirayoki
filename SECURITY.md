# Keep it safe.
Mirayoki serves many Discord servers, so we always try to keep it secure from any kind of exploit from attackers.

**If you find a security vulnerability that we haven't noticed, please report it immediately.**

## I'm not sure if it is a security flaw.

Make yourself these questions:
- Does it affect the data of others? 
- Do other people see private information they are not supposed to?
- Does it put anyone in danger?
- Can it be exploited by an attacker?

If you said yes to any of these questions, chances are that **it is** a security vulnerability.

If you think it is just a bug and **does not** put anyone in danger, you should then [create a new issue](https://github.com/mirei-org/mirayoki/issues/new/choose).

## How to report

> Please, **DO NOT** open an issue reporting the vulnerability.

Please have discretion when reporting a security vulnerability, as other people may read it and may try to exploit it for their own benefit.

It is highly recommended to [send an email to Sebasti√°n Camargo](mailto:scamargo@mirei.org). If possible, please [encrypt it using PGP](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=scamargo%40mirei.org).

In your report please include:
- How the vulnerability can be exploited
- Where is the vulnerability located (e.g. Files, Libraries or Packages)
- What does the vulnerability affects (e.g. Heroku, Database, Libraries, etc.)
- A possible solution for the vulnerability

We always try to make Mirayoki the most secure Discord bot out there, and we try to fix any kind of security threat as soon as possible. After your report, please expect a response in less than 48 hours, and if the vulnerability is fixed, you will be given the respective credit.

We thank you for your help and time.
