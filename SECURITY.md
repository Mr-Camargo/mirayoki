# Keep it safe.
Mirayoki serves many Discord servers, so we always try to keep it secure from any kind of exploit from attackers.

**If you find a Security vulnerabilty which we haven't noticed, please report it immediately.**

## I'm not sure if it is a security flaw.

Make yourself these questions:
- Does it affect the data of others? 
- Does other people see data that are not theirs?
- Does it put any users in danger?
- Can it be exploited by attackers?

If you said yes to any of these questions, chances are that **it is** a security vulnerability.

## How to report

> Please, **DO NOT** open an issue reporting the vulnerability.

Please have discretion when reporting a security vulnerability, as other people may read it and have an idea of how to exploit it for their own benefit.

It is recommended to [send an email to Sebasti√°n Camargo](mailto:camargo@tutamail.com). If possible, please encrypt it using [PGP](https://mr-camargo.github.io/Mr-Camargo/contact/pgp-key.html).

In your report please include:
- How the vulnerability can be exploited
- Where is the vulnerability located (e.g. Files, Libraries or Packages)
- What does the vulnerability affects (e.g. Heroku, Database, Libraries, etc.)
- A possible solution for the vulnerability

We always try to make Mirayoki the most secure Discord bot out there, and we try to fix any kind of security threat as soon as possible. After your report, please expect a response in less than 48 hours.

We thank you for your help and time.
